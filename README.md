## Wordress Graphql (Playground)

This repository is used to play around with WordPress and GraphQL by utilizing the popular [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/), [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugins. The main purpose of this repository is to provide data for frontend developers to build UI using other languages, such as ReactJS, VueJS, Svelte, or others.

Or, as a backend engineer, you can create another interface that consumes data from WordPress and makes it more optimal when accessed by the frontend. For example, you can integrate it with [Golang Wordpress Interface](https://github.com/devetek/gowpgql) and make the application more performant with caching.

You can find examples of its implementation [Golang Web App Boilerplate](https://github.com/devetek/golang-webapp-boilerplate)
